# What is this about?

3/5th project to complete for FCC:s Responsive Web Design certificate.While the project follows the criterias put upon the project I decided to add my  personal flair into it.

Mainly by developing and designing a product landing page to closely resemble one that sells downloadable RAM :)

Enjoy!
